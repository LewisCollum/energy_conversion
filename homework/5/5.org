  - Flux Linkage
  - Phase Leakage
  - _Stator_: The stator is the stationary part of a rotary
    system. Energy flows through a stator to or from the rotating
    component of the system. In an electric motor, the stator provides
    a rotating magnetic field that drives the rotating armature; in a
    generator, the stator converts the rotating magnetic field to
    electric current.
  - Stator Coil Resistance and Stray loss
  - Induced Internal Stator Voltage
